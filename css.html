     <p> Save Tress. Trees usually reproduce using seeds. Flowers and fruit may be present, but some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones.</P>
 <p1>Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce spores instead. </p1>
<p2>Trees are vital. As the biggest plants on the planet, they give us oxygen, store carbon, stabilise the soil and give life to the world's wildlife.</p2>
